<h1><br>A little about my father</br></h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<br><p>Looking back, I noticed that my father had some leadership weaknesses, and one that stood out the most to me was his lack of empathy. He had a strong belief that everyone is responsible for managing their own challenges and situations, which sometimes led him to be less understanding of others’ struggles. An example of this happened during my freshman year of high school.</br> 

<br>One day, I was jumped and badly beaten by some students. When I got home and tried to explain what had happened, I expected comfort or support. Instead, my father seemed uninterested in hearing my side of things. He believed that I should have been able to handle the situation on my own, even though I was clearly outnumbered and shaken by the experience. This response was difficult for me to understand at the time. It made me realize how important empathy is in any kind of leadership or guidance role. Sometimes, people just need to feel heard and supported, rather than being expected to face everything alone.</br>

<br>In reflecting on my father’s leadership, I recognize the qualities of confidence, influence, and responsibility that he embodied—traits I aim to inherit and master as I move forward in life. I chose these qualities because I believe they hold incredible value. Confidence allows a leader’s words to resonate with others and gain their trust. Responsibility builds a reputation for reliability; people are more likely to turn to you when they know you’re dependable. And influence, perhaps the most powerful trait, reflects a leader’s ability to inspire and be respected. It doesn’t place them on a pedestal, but it signifies that others look up to them for guidance and direction. Embracing these traits is something I continue to work on, as I believe they are foundational to becoming a well-rounded and impactful leader.</br>

<br>In conclusion, I see a lot of my father in myself as I grow older. People often tell me that I carry many of his traits, and I hold onto the lessons he taught me with great respect. He instilled values in me that I strive to live by, though there are areas where I feel I could develop more—like confidence and influence. I admire the confidence he had, and at times, I wish I could embody that same self-assurance. He always taught me to lead rather than follow, but I often find myself holding back, hesitant to put my opinions forward or challenge others. Despite these challenges, I’m working on becoming more confident and influential, with the hope of living up to his expectations. As I continue to grow, I aspire to reach the level of strength and respect he had at his peak, honoring his legacy while developing my own unique path.</p></br>
