<h1><img src="My Journey.jpg"><br>My Journey</br></h1>

    Living in Indian Trail you grew up in a very diverse society around you. There are multiple stores and places there like a dentist office, Harris Teeter, Publix and more. There’s also a center filled with many different restaurants inside and other necessities like a nail salon, a hair salon, even an amusement park around the area. 

<br>There are also three main schools which are an elementary school, a middle school and a high school these schools are very popular and have a rich impact on our society because they hold a very deep background in the society and its cultural status, almost majority of the population has either attended the school or has a family member that’s currently attending there. The neighbors are great and very pleasing to the eye.</br> 

<br>The houses are very neat and well looking. They are very pleasing to the eye. The surrounding areas are very quiet. They have very smooth roads. Another thing about living here is the number of things you could do like I said before things like movies, amusement parks, there's also a boxing gym and an arcade. There are a lot of sports centers around there. This town is known for its athletic and agricultural background. Walking around you will see lots of crops being grown all around from corn to wheat to even cotton.</br>
